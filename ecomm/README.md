<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project is based on many shopping websites out there. The main reason behind this project is to test my JavaScript/Express skills I recently learned.

This website dosent use any famous databases like **PostgreSQL** / **MongoBD** beause they were not in the scope of this project, so I used JSON files to locally store the products and carts.

_The sole purpose of this project os to test my JS/Express/Node skills_

### Built With

I used the following technologies to make this website

- [HTML/CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp)
- [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- [Node.js®](https://nodejs.org/en/)
